# Welcome to the PyTutor!
#
# This file is actually a valid Python program--go ahead and try it out in your terminal:
#
#     $ python 00_comments.py
#
# Uhhhhh wait, why didn't it do anything?

# Well, even though this is a valid Python program, it isn't doing anything useful quite yet. But
# then how can we write all of this plain English text here and have Python understand it? Simply
# put, Python is completely ignoring all of this text because of the `#` symbol at the beginning of
# each line. This denotes in Python a "comment" which is super useful to humans like us, less so to
# machines.

# We can also write a bunch of comments in between triples of either single or double quotes:
'''
Just

Like

This
'''
"""
Or

Like

This
"""
# These are normally called "multi-line comments".

# Any of these can be used to write some comments, but typically standard style normally uses
# single-line comments for commenting on individual lines of code and multi-line comments for
# commenting on larger blocks of code such as functions, classes, and modules. For the rest of these
# tutorials, we will use these standard guidelines for practice.

# TODO: Find a better, more interactive way to run through programs
# Furthermore, to try out any of these tutorial files, run them in your terminal like so:
#
#     $ python <TUTORIAL_FILE>
#
# If you encounter any issues running these tutorial files, please feel free to provide feedback in
# the form of an issue at https://github.com/jerluc/pytutor/issues

# Happy coding!
